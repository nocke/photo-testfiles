# photo-testfiles

A set of test photos and videos (and a multitude of mock sidecar and temp files) for testing of [github.com/nocke/photo](https://github.com/nocke/photo)

Focus of these files is on filename parsing and “family” detection (and small size). Not on interesting / high-quality content.
